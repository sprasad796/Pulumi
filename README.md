### Overview

A Pulumi's Cloud Native Python SDK Project to target any Kuberenets environment to provision a cluster , configure and deploy applications, and update them as required.
To learn more about the Pulumi Kuberenets visit the [Pulumi documentation][https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/kubernetes/).

## What is Pulumi?

Pulumi is an open source infrastructure-as-code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure in the programming language of your choice. If you are new to Pulumi, please consider visiting the [getting started](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/) first to familiarize yourself with Pulumi and concepts such as [Pulumi stacks](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/stack/) and [backends](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/).

## Creating Resources on Kubernetes

In Pulumi, resources represent the fundamental units that make up your infrastructure, such as virtual machines, networks, storage and databases. A resource is used to define and manage an infrastructure object in your Pulumi configuration. (https://www.pulumi.com/tutorials/creating-resources-kubernetes/). In this repo, resources has been created and hosted on simple Nginx server hosted Kubernets and further deployed to make Nginx deployment accessible. 

## Prerequisites

The following steps should be completed before start using Kubernetes:

# Pulumi CLI

Download and install Pulumi (https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/)
brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi 

# Pulumi Cloud account
Create login on (https://app.pulumi.com/) and navigate to app.pulumi.com. 
GitHub identity used as to sign up. 

# Run Minikube Cluster
minikube is local Kubernets, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes.
Docker container environment is used to start ```minikube start```

# minikube download
To configure and Install minikube
(https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Farm64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)

On successful installation
Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default

## The Kubernets command line tool kubectl
# kubetctl download
To configure and install kubectl
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

# Kubernetes-installation-and-configuration
Your Pulumi program is required to import the pulumi/kubernetes provider package to allow the Pulumi CLI to authenticate and interact with a running Kubernetes cluster.

By default, Pulumi will use a local kubeconfig if available, or one can be passed as a provider argument in the request.
Installation
The Kubernetes provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:
Python: pulumi-kubernetes

# Set-up
By default, Pulumi will look for a kubeconfig file in the following locations, just like kubectl:

The environment variable: $KUBECONFIG,
Or in current userâ€™s default kubeconfig directory: ~/.kube/config
If the kubeconfig file is not in either of these locations, Pulumi will not find it, and it will fail to authenticate against the cluster. Set one of these locations to a valid kubeconfig file, if you have not done so already.

Verify the cluster is configured and up by running kubectl get pods.
## Python 3.X is installed
